its just a simple if-else stack used inside a for loop 
importnant points are that the for loop starts from 1 not 0 and goes till <=x and 
we have to check for the condition divisble by both 3 and 5 sabse pehle before u check for div by 3 or div by 5
u have to run it by linking it to ur html file and in case of debugging we can use alert or console.log to debug
