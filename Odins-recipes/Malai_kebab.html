    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Malai kebab is a popular Indian dish known for its tender and juicy texture, typically made from marinated pieces of chicken<br>
         or paneer (Indian cottage cheese). The name "malai" refers to cream, which is a key ingredient in the marinade that gives <br>
         the kebabs their rich and creamy flavor.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup fresh cream</li>
        <li>1/4 cup thick yogurt (hung curd or Greek yogurt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cashew paste (soaked cashews ground into a paste)</li>
        <li>2 green chilies (finely chopped)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white pepper powder (or black pepper powder)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon garam masala</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter or ghee (melted, for basting)</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Chopped coriander (for garnish)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Marinate the chicken:<br>
            In a large bowl, combine the cream, yogurt, cashew paste, ginger-garlic paste, green chilies, pepper, lemon juice, garam masala,<br>
             and salt. Mix well. Add the chicken pieces to the marinade and coat them evenly. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours <br>
             (or overnight for best results).</li>
        <li>Skewer the chicken:<br>
            Once the chicken has marinated, thread the pieces onto skewers. If using wooden skewers, soak them in water for 30 minutes<br>
             to prevent burning.
            
            </li>
        <li>Preheat the grill/oven:<br>
            Preheat your grill or oven to 200°C (390°F). If using an oven, you can also use the broil function for a charred effect.</li>
        <li>Grill the kebabs:
            Place the skewers on the grill or in the oven. Baste the chicken with melted butter or ghee. Grill for 12-15 minutes,<br>
             turning occasionally, until the chicken is cooked through and slightly charred at the edges. Baste with butter or<br>
              ghee a couple of times during grilling for added flavor and moisture.
            
            </li>
        <li>Serve:<br>
            Remove the kebabs from the grill and let them rest for a few minutes. Garnish with chopped coriander. <br>
            Serve hot with mint chutney, onion rings, and lemon wedges.</li>
