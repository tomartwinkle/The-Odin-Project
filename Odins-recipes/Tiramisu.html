    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Tiramisu is a classic Italian dessert known for its rich, creamy layers and <br>
        distinct coffee flavor. The name "tiramisu" translates to "pick me up," referring to the invigorating combination <br>
        of coffee and cocoa.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>6 egg yolks</li>
    <li>3/4 cup sugar</li>
    <li>1 cup mascarpone cheese (room temperature)</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups heavy cream (chilled)</li>
    <li>2 cups strong brewed coffee or espresso (cooled)</li>
    <li>1/4 cup coffee liqueur (optional, such as Kahl√∫a)</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>2 packs ladyfingers (savoiardi biscuits)</li>
    <li>Unsweetened cocoa powder (for dusting)</li>
    <li>Dark chocolate shavings (optional, for garnish)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the mascarpone mixture:<br>

            In a heatproof bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar.<br>
            Place the bowl over a pot of simmering water (double boiler method) and whisk continuously until the mixture becomes thick <br>
            and pale in color (about 5-8 minutes). Remove from heat and let it cool slightly.<br>
            Once cooled, fold in the mascarpone cheese until smooth and creamy.</li>
        <li>Whip the cream:<br>

            In a separate bowl, whisk the heavy cream and vanilla extract until stiff peaks form. Be careful not to over-whip it.</li>
        <li>Combine the mascarpone and whipped cream:<br>

            Gently fold the whipped cream into the mascarpone mixture until combined and smooth. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Prepare the coffee dip:<br>

            In a shallow dish, combine the cooled coffee (or espresso) with coffee liqueur (if using).</li>
        <li>Assemble the tiramisu:<br>

            Quickly dip each ladyfinger into the coffee mixture, ensuring both sides are soaked but not too soggy (just a couple of seconds).<br>
            Place them in a single layer in the bottom of your serving dish (9x9 inch or similar).<br>
            Spread half of the mascarpone cream mixture over the layer of ladyfingers.<br>
            Add another layer of coffee-soaked ladyfingers on top of the cream.<br>
            Spread the remaining mascarpone mixture over the second layer of ladyfingers, smoothing it evenly.</li>
        <li>Chill the tiramisu:<br>

            Cover the dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight. This allows the flavors to meld <br>
            and the dessert to set properly.</li>
        <li>Serve:<br>

            Before serving, dust the top generously with unsweetened cocoa powder.<br>
            Optionally, garnish with dark chocolate shavings.</li>
    </ol>
