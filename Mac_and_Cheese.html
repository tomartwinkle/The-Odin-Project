    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Mac and cheese, short for macaroni and cheese, is a classic comfort food dish made primarily of cooked <br>
        macaroni pasta and a creamy cheese sauce. The dish typically features a blend of cheeses, such as cheddar<br>
    Gruyère, or mozzarella, combined with a béchamel sauce (a white sauce made from butter, flour, and milk) <br>
    or a simpler cheese sauce.
</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups elbow macaroni (or any other pasta you prefer)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cups milk (whole milk or 2%)</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded cheddar cheese (sharp cheddar for more flavor)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon mustard powder (optional, for flavor)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder (optional)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon paprika (for garnish)</li>
        <li>Breadcrumbs (optional, for topping)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the pasta:<br>
            Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the macaroni and cook according to package instructions until <br>
            al dente (firm to the bite). Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Prepare the cheese sauce:<br>
            In a large saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Once melted, add the flour and whisk continuously <br>
            for about 1-2 minutes to create a roux (a thick paste). This helps thicken the sauce.</li>
        <li>Add the cheese:
            Once the sauce is thickened, reduce the heat to low. Stir in the shredded cheddar cheese and Parmesan cheese <br>
            until melted and smooth. Add mustard powder, garlic powder (if using), salt, and pepper.<br>
             Stir until everything is well combined and the sauce is creamy.</li>
        <li>Combine pasta and sauce:<br>
            Add the cooked macaroni to the cheese sauce and stir until the pasta is well coated.</li>
        <li>Optional baking step:<br>
            If you like a crispy topping, preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Transfer the mac and cheese to a baking dish. <br>
            Sprinkle breadcrumbs and a little extra cheese on top. Bake for about 15-20 minutes until golden and bubbly.
            
            </li>
        <li>Serve:<br>
            Garnish with a sprinkle of paprika and serve hot.</li>
     
    </ol>
