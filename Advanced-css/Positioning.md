# Positioning
### CSS Position Property

| **Value**     | **Description**                                                                 |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `static`      | Default position. Elements are placed in the normal document flow (no offset).   |
| `relative`    | Positioned relative to its normal position. You can offset using `top`, `left`. |
| `absolute`    | Positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (not `static`).           |
| `fixed`       | Positioned relative to the viewport. Doesn't move on scroll.                    |
| `sticky`      | Behaves like `relative` until a scroll threshold, then acts like `fixed`.       |

The feature in websites where we can see the menu bar even when we scroll is achieved using sticky positioning !!!
