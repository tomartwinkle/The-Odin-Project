## What is Browser Compatibility?
- Ensures web applications work across different browsers.
- Browsers use different rendering engines:
  - Chrome/Edge/Brave: Blink (Chromium-based)
  - Safari: WebKit
- Apps may behave differently in different browsers.
- Most developers prioritize Chrome/Chromium due to market dominance.

## CSS Features and Browser Support
- **W3C** sets web standards and works with browser vendors.
- In the past, lack of standards meant inconsistent behavior across browsers.
- Today, browser support is more unified due to standardization.

### When is it safe to use new CSS features?
- Use [Can I Use](https://caniuse.com) to check browser support.
- Implement new features once widely supported by major browsers.
- Avoid breaking user experience by testing thoroughly.

## Mobile Browser Considerations
- Mobile usage is growing; ensure mobile compatibility.
- On iOS/iPadOS, all browsers use **WebKit** under the hood.
  - Chrome/Firefox on iOS = still Safari engine.
- Emulators in browsers only simulate screen size, not full mobile behavior.
- Always test on actual mobile devices when possible.

## Key Takeaways
- Test on all major browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge).
- Use feature detection and compatibility checks.
- Prioritize responsive and mobile-friendly designs.
- Stay updated with evolving browser technologies and standards.
