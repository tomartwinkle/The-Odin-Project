# CSS Frameworks & Preprocessors

## What Are CSS Frameworks?
- Pre-written CSS that speeds up development.
- Help build reusable, responsive, and consistent UIs.
- Provide utility classes (e.g., `.btn` for buttons) and components.

### Examples of CSS Frameworks:
- **Bootstrap**: Offers ready-made components and layouts.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first approach; use small, single-purpose classes.
- **Bulma**, **Foundation**: Other popular frameworks.

### Disadvantages of Frameworks:
- Can result in **similar-looking websites**.
- Tempting to use too early, **skipping core CSS learning**.
- **Overriding styles** or debugging can be difficult without CSS knowledge.
- Once adopted, **hard to remove** from a project.

## What Are CSS Preprocessors?
- Tools/languages that extend CSS features.
- Allow loops, variables, conditionals, and imports.
- **Compiled** into regular CSS before deployment.

### Popular CSS Preprocessors:
- **SASS**
- **LESS**
- **Stylus**

### Note:
- Many features of preprocessors (e.g., variables, nesting) are now available in **modern CSS**.
- May not be worth the overhead unless project complexity demands it.
