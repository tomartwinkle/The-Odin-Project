    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Cookies are small, sweet baked treats that come in various shapes, sizes, and flavors. Typically made from a mixture of flour<br>
        sugar, and fat (such as butter or oil), cookies can include additional <br>
        ingredients like chocolate chips, nuts, dried fruit, and oats. They can be chewy or crispy, <br>
        depending on the recipe and baking time.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup (226g) unsalted butter (softened)</li>
        <li>3/4 cup (150g) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 cup (165g) brown sugar (packed)</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 1/4 cups (280g) all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 cups (340g) semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped nuts (optional, like walnuts or pecans)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven:<br>
            Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Cream the butter and sugars:<br>
            In a large bowl, beat the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy, about 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add eggs and vanilla:<br>
            Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.
            
            </li>
        <li>Mix the dry ingredients:<br>
            In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt.
            
            </li>
        <li>Combine wet and dry ingredients:<br>
            Gradually add the flour mixture into the butter and sugar mixture, mixing until just combined (do not overmix).
            
            </li>
        <li>Fold in the chocolate chips and nuts:<br>
            Stir in the chocolate chips and nuts (if using) until evenly distributed in the dough.</li>
        <li>Scoop and bake:<br>
            Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart.</li>
        <li>Bake:<br>
            Bake for 8-10 minutes, or until the edges are golden but the centers are still soft. The cookies will continue to cook slightly after being removed from the oven.
            
            </li>
        <li>Cool:<br>
            Let the cookies cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>

    </ol>
