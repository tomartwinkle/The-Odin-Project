# Inspecting 
## Accessing the Inspector

Right-click on any element of a webpage and select “Inspect” or press F12 to open Chrome DevTools.
## Inspecting Elements:

In the Elements panel, you can see the full HTML structure of the page.
Use the blue-highlighted icon to hover over and select any element on the page.
The Styles panel shows the current styles applied to the selected element and highlights any overwritten styles (with a strikethrough).
## Testing Styles in Real-Time:

In the Styles panel, you can directly edit CSS styles by clicking on selectors, attributes, or values, and the changes will be reflected immediately on the webpage. This does not alter your actual source code but is great for experimenting.
## Knowledge Check:
### How do you select a specific element on your page with your browser’s developer tools?

You can select an element by clicking on it in the Elements panel, or by using the blue-highlighted icon to hover over elements on the page, which will highlight them in the HTML structure.
### What does a strikethrough in a CSS declaration mean in your browser’s developer tools?

A strikethrough indicates that the style is being overridden by another rule, usually due to CSS specificity or cascading order.
### How do you change CSS in real time on specific elements of a web page with your browser’s developer tools?

You can change CSS by clicking inside the Styles panel on the specific selector or value you want to edit. Once you make changes, the page will immediately reflect them in real-time.
