# Block and Inline 
There are 2 types of elements, block and inline elements or we can even say 2 types of boxes.<br>
1. **Block elements :** they stack vertically and take up the entire width of their container. They Start on a new line and push any following content to the next line. Hence,
 they are ideal for structuring and creating defined distinctions between elements on a webpage. <br>
 Use Cases: Often used for layout purposes to create separate sections, such as headers, footers, and paragraphs. <br>
Examples: < div >, < p >, < h1 >, and < section >. <br>
<br>

2. **Inline elements :** Inline elements only take up as much width as their content requires, without disrupting the flow of surrounding content.
They are ideal for styling individual portions of text or elements within a block.They appear within a line w/o  breaking to a new line. <br>
Use Cases: Used for styling within a line of text, like links, bold text, or inline images. <br>
Examples: < a >, < span >, < strong >, and < em > <br><br>

3. **Inline-Block Elements :** Hybrid Behavior; Combines properties of both inline and block elements.
 Like block elements, you can adjust width, height, padding, and margin.
Stays inline with other elements without breaking to a new line. <br>
Use Cases: Useful for aligning items horizontally while maintaining block-style properties.
## Divs and Spans
Both of these are non-semantic elements they are like empty containers and their use cases are to either group certain elements together that need similar styling or put some elements under the same parent elements etc.
1. **Div :** Div is a block elements and it groups together block level contents and creates different sections for styling. <br>
Example: Wrapping a set of paragraphs or images to apply shared styling or layout properties. <br><br>
2. **Span :** Span is an inline element .Used to style specific inline parts of text or other inline elements within a block. <br>
Example: Highlighting a word or phrase within a paragraph for emphasis. <br><br>
#### Additional 
Block elements are best for laying out structure: < div >, < p >, < header >, etc. <br>
Inline elements are great for styling text and small items within content flow: < a >, < span >, < img >, etc.
Normal flow : Refers to how elements naturally position themselves on a page without any additional styling.
