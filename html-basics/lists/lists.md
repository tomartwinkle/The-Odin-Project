# Lists

1. Ordered List: Created using the <ol> tag, it generates a numbered list. Each list item is wrapped in the <li> tag. <br>
Example: A list of steps or numbered items.<br><br>
2. Unordered List: Created using the <ul> tag, it generates a bulleted list. Each list item is also wrapped in the <li> tag.<br>

Example: A list of features or options.<br>
<br>
Both types of lists are useful for organizing content. The main difference is that ordered lists are numbered, while unordered lists are bulleted.
