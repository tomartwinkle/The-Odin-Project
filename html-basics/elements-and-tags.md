# Elements and Tags 
## HTML 
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is used to create the structure of web pages using elements and tags. HTML elements are the building blocks of a webpage,
<br>such as paragraphs, images, and links. Each element is enclosed within opening and closing tags.
### Tags
Tags: Tags are special keywords surrounded by angle brackets, like <p> for a paragraph. Tags come in pairs: <br>
Opening tag: Marks the start of an element (e.g., <p>).<br>
Closing tag: Marks the end of an element (e.g., </p>).<br>
For example, <p>Some text</p> creates a paragraph
<br>
#### Void elements
Some tags, called void elements, don’t need a closing tag. For example:
<br>
<br> (line break) adds a line break without needing a closing tag. <br>
<img> (image) embeds an image but doesn’t wrap content.<br>
These are sometimes called self-closing tags, which may include a forward slash, like <br /> or <img />. <br>
However, the latest HTML standards discourage using self-closing tags.
