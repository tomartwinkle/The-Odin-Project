# Working with Text 
1. Paragraphs: Use the p tag to create a paragraph. Each p tag wraps a block of text. <br>

2. Headings: HTML offers six heading levels, from h1 to h6. h1 is the largest and most important, while h6 is the smallest.<br>

3. Bold Text: To make text bold, we can use the b tag or for emphasis, use strong.<br>

4. Italicized Text: Use the i tag to italicize text, or em for emphasis.<br>

5. Relationships Between Nested Elements: HTML elements can be nested inside each other, meaning one tag can go inside another (e.g., a paragraph can contain bold or italic text). It has a parents child relationship.<br>

6. HTML Comments: You can add comments in HTML using !-- comment here -- inside tags. Comments won't appear on the webpage but are useful for notes within the code.
