# Dynamic User Interface Interactions
## Drop Down Menus
Dropdowns are typically comprised of two main parts:

A button that toggles the dropdown content’s visibility.
The dropdown content itself.
The dropdown toggle button should typically only trigger the visibility of the dropdown content on click, while the dropdown contents should typically only contain items that will trigger an action upon clicking them. Actions can include things like “Edit”, “Copy”, or “Delete”, or linking you to another part of the site, such as in a navbar.
## Image Carousel
Typically, they consist of a div that acts as the “picture frame”, where behind that div, there is another much wider div containing the carousel’s images. This strip of images can then move behind the picture frame, showing a different image depending on what part of the strip is visible. Any additional controls or features can then be placed on top of the entire thing
