# OOPS Principles
# Single Responsibility and Loose Coupling (self learn)
| Principle                 | What It Means                               | Why It Helps                                |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Single Responsibility** | A class/module/function should do ONE job   | Prevents entanglement, easier changes       |
| **Loose Coupling**        | Parts shouldnâ€™t rely on each other too much | Makes code modular, swappable, and testable |
