# Remotes

Here's a typical workflow when working with the original repo and your own fork:

```bash
git fetch upstream main
git checkout your_branch_name
git push origin your_branch_name
# Create Pull Request to Upstream Repository
# Maintainers review and merge
```
## git push --force (Danger)
Why it's risky:
- Overwrites remote history
- Can destroy work others have added
- Should be avoided in team settings unless necessary

Example that causes loss:
```
git rebase -i --root
# Removed a commit accidentally
git push --force
```
Safer alternatives:
Instead of force-pushing, use:
```
git fetch origin
git merge origin/main
```
Undoing Commits Safely
You made a mistake and want to undo a commit?
Use:
```
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
This adds a new commit that reverses the last commitâ€”safe for teams!
```
When is git push --force OK?
- Updating your own pull request (when you're the only one working on the branch)
- Removing sensitive info (like API keys accidentally pushed)
- Use --force-with-lease instead of --force:
```
git push --force-with-lease
It checks if the remote branch has been updated before overwriting!
```
Dangers & Best Practices for History-Altering Commands

- NEVER rewrite public/shared history without talking to teammates.
- Use these commands only on branches you work on alone.
- The -f or --force flag should make you stop and double-check.
- Avoid rewriting history if the branch is already pushed
