# 📂 Why We Ignore `node_modules` and `dist` in Git

When working with npm packages in a JavaScript project, it's important to avoid tracking certain directories like `node_modules/` and `dist/` in Git and GitHub. Here's a full breakdown of why and how to do this properly.

---

## 📦 `node_modules` Should Not Be Tracked

### ❓ What is it?
`node_modules/` contains **all the dependencies** installed via npm.

### 🚫 Why ignore it?
- It can contain **thousands of files** and be several hundred MB in size.
- It's not written by you — it’s **generated locally** by npm.
- It can always be recreated using:
  ```bash
  npm install
# Alternative
Instead of pushing node_modules, you just commit:

 - package.json – lists your dependencies.

 - package-lock.json – locks versions for consistency.
 Anyone can run `npm install` to regenerate node_modules/.

## dist/ Should Not Be Tracked
❓ What is it? <br><br>
dist/ is the output directory generated by bundlers like Webpack. It contains compiled JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and assets.

🚫 Why ignore it?<br><br>
- It is auto-generated and can always be rebuilt.

- Keeping it in Git is unnecessary and may cause merge issues.

- To rebuild it:
```
npm run build
```
📄 What is .gitignore?<br><br>
.gitignore is a text file where you list files and folders that Git should ignore.
<br><br>
🧾 Example .gitignore for Node Projects
`
node_modules/
dist/
.env
.DS_Store
`
This tells Git:

- Don’t track node_modules/ or dist/

- Ignore .env for sensitive config variables

- Ignore .DS_Store (Mac system file)

🌐 GitHub's .gitignore Templates
When creating a new GitHub repo, you can select a .gitignore template (e.g. Node) which includes:
`
node_modules/
dist/
`
This saves you time and avoids common mistakes.
